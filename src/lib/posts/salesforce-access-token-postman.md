description: Use the Salesforce Platform APIs Collection within Postman to obtain an access token
---

In this example, we make use of the Salesforce Platform APIs Collection within Postman.

We can think of a Collection as group a pre-configured HTTP requests (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)

As such, the Salesforce Platform APIs Collection has many pre-configured requests. However, we are only concerned with the access token request.

The steps below will illustrate:

- adding the Salesforce Platform APIs Collection to Postman
- making the access token request
- using the access token

## 1. Log In / Sign Up

- use desktop or web app

## 2. Add the Collection

something else

## 3. Request Access Token

even more stuff

## 4. Use the Access Token
