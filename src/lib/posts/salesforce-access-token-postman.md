description: Use the Salesforce Platform APIs Collection within Postman to obtain an access token
---

In this example, we make use of the Salesforce Platform APIs Collection within Postman.

We can think of a Collection as group a pre-configured HTTP requests (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)

As such, the Salesforce Platform APIs Collection has many pre-configured requests. However, we are only concerned with the access token request.

The steps below will illustrate adding the Platform APIs Collection to the Postman application, and then making the access token request.

## 1. Log In / Sign Up

- use desktop or web app

## 2. Add the Collection

something else

## 3. Request Access Token

even more stuff

## 4. Use the Access Token
